# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023


## WEEK O:
Here is an overview of what was discussed in week zero of the bootcamp

### GITHUB SEMANTIC VERSIONING
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

- Typically, on GitHub, an [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) is created for either a bug fix or the addition of a feature to a software project. 
- Once the issue has been created, the issue's name is used to create a feature branch from Github GUI or by using the *git checkout -b (branchname)* command.
- After developing the code in the feature branch, we commit and push it to the remote repository. Then, we proceed to create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
- Once the pull request is accepted, a tag is created to preserve the project's state.
